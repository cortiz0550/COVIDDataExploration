# COVID Data Exploration

## Basic skills Demonstration
This project was meant to look at an interesting, clean dataset and to see what findings could be generated. I found this dataset through Alex the
Analyst online, and the files come from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

Some of the skills demonstrated in this project include:
- Aggregate functions
- String function operations
- Joins
- Nested queries
- CTEs
- Partitions

I found this project helpful to refresh what I have learned, but also challenging enough to keep me improving. Going forward, I want to get a better understanding
of when to use CTEs and Window functions, as I felt that I had to look up a lot when building them in this project.
